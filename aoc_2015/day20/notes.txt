# Each Elf delivers presents equal to ten times his or her number at each house.
# elf 1 - every house      10 presents
# elf 7 - 7th house        70 presents
# elf 100 - 100th house    1000 presents


can yeild a set of numbers for the given elf upto a limit?

so elf 1 1,2,3,4,5,6,....
so elf 2 2,4,6,8,10
so elf 3 3,6,9
n = n+1

yield (n+1, (n+1)*presents)



can create tuples of the houses and presents for each elf they are delivering too
can we then subm all based on the first number in the tuple?
