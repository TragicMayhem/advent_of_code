Multiple read through and working out, but finally got there.  
Not sure I would without assistance in future!

inp a
add a b 
mul a b 
div a b
mod a b 
eql a b 

a will always be the answer
cautious 
div 0
mod a<0 b<=0


sub model numbers are 14 digits
1-9 NOT 0

inp will always be 1-9

valid if 0 in z
any other number is invalid

=====

Not straight forward ALU processing, I find out, its about reverse engineering a 14 digit number

Hints: 
The pattern off the instructions is mis-leading as some are pointless.
There are hints about push/pop  (so guess a queue)
and three numbers are key. once you simplify the instructions

inp w       input number         = w
mul x 0     will always give 0  x = 0
add x z     always matches z    x = z
mod x 26    x mod 26            x = x % 26
div z 1     always be z         z = z
add x 14    x = x + 14          x = (x % 26) + 14 = (z % 26) +14
eql x w     x = 0 or 1 (x=w)   
eql x 0     x = 0 or 1 (x=0)
mul y 0                         y = 0
add y 25                        y = 25    
mul y x     y will be 26 or 0   y = 25 or 0    
add y 1                         y = 26 or 1
mul z y     z = y * z           y = z*26 or z*1
mul y 0                         y = 0   
add y w     y = y + w           y = w
add y 12    y = y + 12          y = y + 12 = w + 12
mul y x     y = y * x           y = (w + 12) * x so (w + 12) or 0
add z y                         z = z + y  so z + w + 12 or 0

need z to have zero to be a valid number

after #6  +14 then x will never eq w (1to9) so that will be 0 (#7)
so #8 x will always be 0 so when it =0 x is set to 1  (from #9 onwards x=1)


two types of blocks  (div z 1 and div z 26)
others on reddit all talk about stacks (queues) with former pushing on and latter popping
7 on and 7 off to work out digits of the number, and the difference being the checks.

solve pairs of digits, in the 14 digit number.
pairs mean one will be 9, other will be 9 -/+ diff
